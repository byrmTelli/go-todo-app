<h2>Hello!</h2>
<p>This is my very first go rest api project that i built to learn fundamentals. To take a look closer to this app your can just clone the repo to your machine and run the commands below: </p>

```
cd go-todo-app
```

```
go run main.go
```

<p>If you get an error while running app just make sure you have installed golang to your machine.</p>
<p>This is just a practice project and it contains; </p>
<ul>
    <li>Json Web Token Implementation(token generation and route authorization),</li>
    <li>Password hashing,</li>
    <li>Routing with mux lib,</li>
    <li>Database management with gorm,</li>
    <li>Swagger Documentation configurations,</li>
</ul>
